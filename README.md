# radarpy
Radarpy helps system admins and researchers map our an infrastructure's install base. It's a cross-platform program (currently only OS X) that runs in the background, and checks for installed applications, services and commands. This helps in aggregating installations of various programs and their versions for detecting vulnerable installations, policy compliance, asset management, project management and software research. The application list can then be exported to JSON, XML, CSV or transfered to service accepting requests. We also are looking to add port scanning functionality to map open ports on the machines. 

## Requirements
Packages required:
- Python 2.7+
- lxml

Most of the program calls on the Python standard library.

## Immediate To Do 

- Build Windows application detection
- Build Linux application detection
- Export application list to JSON
- Export application list to CSV
- Export application list to XML
- Transfer application list to another service through POST / GET requests
